[{"content":"Pittsburgh Zoo A gorgeous, outdoor park style zoo. Animals from around the world preserved and cared for by expert staff. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of fun to be had at the zoo, and I highly recommend it as a day trip to anyone.\nWhat to Expect Pittsburgh Zoo is located along the North River, on top of the Highland Park. Asphalt pathways snaking up and down the forested hills. Be prepared for a bit cardio on scenic walk along a journey through the park.\nEssentials to Bring Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to pack these few things, and you will find your Zoo trip to be mountains more enjoyable.\nSunscreen Hats for sun shade Umbrellas (check your weather forecast) Reusable Water Bottles Park Water fountains Available with bottle fill styles occasionally Optional\nWhile not strictly necessary, taking along these extras will enhance your experience and save you money Packed Bag Lunches Binoculars (Low Medium magnifying) Comfortable Bag\nGo ahead and anything else that you find to enhance your personal confort at a park, take along, just check against the park\u0026rsquo;s guidelines here Your Time Plannibg on how long you plan to stay at the park is a matter of how long you want to stay at each exhibit. I find that on average, 5 hours can get you a leisurely trip around to all the major attractions with time for lunch.\nThe park is opened from 9:30 am to 5:30 pm. Members can enter the park 30 minutes early.\nI took this picture of a Freak Flamingo\nGo have fun at the Zoo. Give them money, they are doing construction right now to make it better. You need to go to the zoo. Blah Blah Balh yap yap yap.\nThe end.\n","date":"2025-05-09T10:29:46-04:00","permalink":"https://www.gidgee.net/posts/fun-at-the-zoo/","title":"Fun at the Zoo"},{"content":"(Note: Mobile can find it in the 3 bar dropdown)\nEsentially just a bare-bones unmodified version of this post is just given a spotlight link on the left side.

If I didn\u0026rsquo;t use it, I would have lost some good progress.\nI also lost the progress because of git.\nGit is a controller for \u0026lsquo;version control\u0026rsquo; or a fancy way of tracking you files\nI\u0026rsquo;ve heard of it called something like a save file in a video game, where everything you do up to a point is frozen in time, ready for you to return to at any moment.\nlast edited: May 19, 2025 12:25:19 pm ","date":"2025-05-05T10:45:33-04:00","permalink":"https://www.gidgee.net/posts/git-sucks/","title":"Git Sucks*"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m really having fun Hugo is deep, complex, and a little intimidating.
