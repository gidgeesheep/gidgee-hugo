THIS IS MY BIG FAT README FILE

-- BUGLIST --
1. When entering a post from the searc page, the theme flips (SOMETIMES!!, i just checked and now its not doing it ðŸ˜¡)
2. Light Mode => The >BLOCKQUOTE and the ```CODEBLOCK``` do not have enough contrast to be seen as separate elements
    -> moreover, the CODEBLOCK style only surrounds the text with its background color instead of affecting a content block
   + SUGGESTION : Check on the code that decides what MARKUP does and see if the colors are decided based on the stuff in there
3. Transparent Gifs: When using the standard image gallary shortcode of ![example text](imagefile.img), a pre-rendered static ghost
    -> is generated, probably from the <PhotoSwipe> special integrated JavaScript gallery program, its just annoying but i can get
    -> the problem by using inline html code to add the .gif file directly
    NOTE : this doesn't matter for all gifs, only ones with transparency
    + SUGGESTION : Look into the way <PhotoSwipe> handles images, my guess


-- WISHLIST --
What I just hope with all my heart I can make of this project
1. Command Line Git uploading to server
    -> Get a git repo set onto the server so I don't have to do drag and drop crap anymore. If I keep working on this project,
    -> it'll snowball out of control, and drag an drop will be the death of the website.
2. A custom, to my liking, built by me, UNDERSTOOD by me, drag and drop photo gallery
