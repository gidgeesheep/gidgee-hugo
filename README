THIS IS MY BIG FAT README FILE

-- BUGLIST --
1. When entering a post from the search page, the theme flips (SOMETIMES!!, I just checked and now its not doing it ðŸ˜¡)

2. Light Mode => The >BLOCKQUOTE and the ```CODEBLOCK``` do not have enough contrast to be seen as separate elements
    -> moreover, the CODEBLOCK style only surrounds the text with its background color instead of affecting a content block
   + SUGGESTION : Check on the code that decides what MARKUP does and see if the colors are decided based on the stuff in there

3. Transparent Gifs: When using the standard image gallary shortcode of ![example text](imagefile.img), a pre-rendered static ghost
    -> is generated, probably from the <PhotoSwipe> special integrated JavaScript gallery program, its just annoying but I can get
    -> the problem by using inline html code to add the .gif file directly
    NOTE : this doesn't matter for all gifs, only ones with transparency
    + SUGGESTION : Look into the way <PhotoSwipe> handles images, my guess

4. date posted time in Gallery is screwed up

-- WISHLIST --
What I just hope with all my heart I can make of this project
1. Command Line Git uploading to server
    -> Get a git repo set onto the server so I don't have to do drag and drop crap anymore. If I keep working on this project,
    -> it'll snowball out of control, and drag an drop will be the death of the website.

2. A custom, to my liking, built by me, UNDERSTOOD by me, drag and drop photo gallery

3. A sitewide background image, just abstract color to break up the sad and lonely monotone default background

4. Something called 'Cache Busting' so my static website gets updated and doesn't let the browser used its cached site

5. Maybe a section about the authors if more than myself writes articles for this website

6. Get the words 'dark mode' to change and say 'light mode' when you click on it

-- ACCOMPLISHMENTS --
1. Automatic last updated footer

2. An author can now be put as a param in a webpage and appear on the header details
