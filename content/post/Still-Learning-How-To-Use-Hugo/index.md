## I'm really having fun
Hugo is deep, complex, and a little intimidating. I'm really enjoying getting better with every moment of learning.  
Lucky for me, things have been getting easier and easier every day.

You can visit the HUGO website [here](https://gohugo.io/) and you can get the theme I use [here](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack),  
minus all of my configuration changes of course.

There is a ton of stuff left to do, from editing the configs defaulty introduced of the theme, as well as inventing my own.

For god sakes I haven't even got many posts to begin with. But I'm changing that slowly ðŸ˜Š, and little tweaks and addtions will pop up everywhere with time. This website will be my own.  

## TODO
There are a few things that I have to keep working on to get this site up to peak
 - [x] Find out how to make this checkbox work
 - [ ] Add a comments section
 - [ ] Get the last edited thing working at the bottom of the page
 - [ ] Add color to the background, grey and white is like ðŸ¤®
 - [ ] Photo Gallery!? I don't even know how the menus on the left side work, but I'd put it there!
 
There are more things to do but I'm no going to list it all here.
