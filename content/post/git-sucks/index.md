# I want to bitch about Git
Don't read this if you are a git wizard, this isn't for you. I use git. I'm using git for this project right now.
If I didn't use it, I would have lost some good progress.  
I also lost the progress **because** of *git*.

Git is a controller for 'version control' or a fancy way of tracking you files

I've heard of it called something like a save file in a video game, where everything you do up to a point is frozen in time, ready for you to return to at any moment.
