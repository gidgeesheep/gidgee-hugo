# Hello and Welcome
This is my mini personal blog, ran by myself for my own enjoyment. You can find articles of my thoughts and other things I find interesting posted here. I'm continually updating and developing this website as I learn more and more about web development, HUGO, html, css, and many other skills. There are many features that I hope to add and lots of personalization left to be done. 

## Comments
I haven't implimented comments as of writing this. This will be a rules section maybe?
